# BCI-Authentication

**OVERVIEW** 

Neural Lock will be a potential new form of biometric identification that can be used to unlock a device. As neurotechnology becomes more advanced and convenient this type of technology could have many uses. Neurotechnology has many strengths making it an incentive to be utilized. One extreme strength for this is security for the individual and the system. Brain waves are always active in the mind until death. At this point the term "Brain Dead" is used and there is no longer any brain activity active. This would make it impossible for anyone to authenticate as this individual keeping the data safe. In this project we plan to create a deep neural network that will be able to authenticate a user with high accuracy. As well as making it almost impossible for any other user to be accepted into the system. 

**GOALS**

The goal of this project is to build and model, using a neural network,  an individual’s brain waves to successfully authenticate the user into an end device such as a desktop computer or a phone. This authentication method would be a form of biometrics that doesn’t rely on a physical method of authentication such as a password, passphrase, or fingerprint. It would be something that someone doesn’t necessarily have to say or write down or have on their person. This method of authentication would be something you think or visually see.
